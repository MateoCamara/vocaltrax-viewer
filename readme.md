# VocalTrax Viewer

A web-based GUI to visualize and play articulatory parameters generated by the [VocalTrax synthesizer](https://github.com/PapayaResearch/vocaltrax).

This tool allows you to dynamically load generated sounds and see a visual representation of the Pink Trombone articulatory model, making it easy to debug, analyze, and share synthesis results.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Loading:** Add new sounds by running a simple command.
-   **Visual Feedback:** See the tongue, lips, and constrictions move as the sound plays.
-   **Simple Workflow:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with the output of the VocalTrax synthesizer.

### ⚠️ Important Limitations: Simplified Model

Please note that this viewer uses a **simplified implementation** of the original Pink Trombone model for visualization purposes. As a result, certain acoustic features are **not present**:
-   **No Fricative Noise:** The model does not generate the hissing noise (frication) that occurs when a constriction in the vocal tract becomes very narrow (essential for sounds like 's', 'sh', or 'f'). This is a modification in tract.js
-   **No Aspiration/Breathy Sounds:** The effect of low `voiceness` values, which should produce breathy or aspirated sounds (like the 'h' in 'hello'), is not implemented. This is a modifcation in glottis.js

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
2.  A `params_pink_trombone.json` file generated by the VocalTrax synthesizer.

## How to Use

The process is designed to be straightforward. After generating a sound with VocalTrax, you use our converter script to add it to this viewer.

### Step 1: Run a Local Server

Because this project uses the `fetch` API, you cannot open the `index.html` file directly in your browser from the filesystem. You need to serve it from a local web server.

If you have Python installed, the easiest way is to run this command from the project's root directory:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

*(Alternatively, if you use VS Code, the "Live Server" extension is a great option.)*

### Step 2: Add a New Sound

Let's say you have just generated a sound and its parameter file is located at `~/Downloads/params_pink_trombone.json`.

1.  Open your terminal in the root directory of this `VocalTrax-Viewer` project.

2.  Run the included `params_converter.py` script. It takes two arguments:
    -   The path to the input `.json` file from VocalTrax.
    -   The desired name for your sound in the GUI (e.g., `hello_world`).

    The command format is:
    ```bash
    python converter.py <path_to_input_json> <desired_config_name>
    ```
    
### What Just Happened?

The `params_converter.py` script automatically did two things for you:

1.  **Converted the Format:** It created a new configuration file, correctly formatted for the GUI, at `src/tract_configs/hello_world.json`.
2.  **Updated the Manifest:** It automatically added `hello_world.json` to the `src/tract_configs/manifest.json` file, so the GUI knows to load it.

### Step 3: View the Result

Refresh the `index.html` page in your browser. You will now see a new button or a new option in the dropdown list labeled "hello_world". Click it to see your new sound visualized!
